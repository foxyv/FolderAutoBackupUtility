The "Show Folder Status" actionPressed event now creates a new status window for the folder selected in the folderList.

Added constructor which can accept a VernaFolder object.
Added a caption which automatically changes to the folder's name.
Added a sorted list of files within the directory.

NOTE: Need a browser of sorts so we can cover subdirectories. Perhaps a folderBrowser class and a tree for the display instead of a list.
